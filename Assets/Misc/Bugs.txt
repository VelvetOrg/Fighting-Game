This is a log of all the known issues with the game that are yet to be fixed

To do:
- Standing on an object tagged 'Rigidbody' Causes them to glitch out
- Rigidbodys do not realistically interact with the character controller
- The gun and arm can be depth culled when walking into objects
- When bunny hoppig the gun will continue the head bob sine wave for a frame
- Falling down a slope does not have any acceleration
- Pushing a rigidbody will cause them to glitch out (slightly)
- Bullets can bend when moving fast enough

Fixed:
- Bullets do not travel straight from the gun when rotating
- Lerping of the arms rotation is not smooth
